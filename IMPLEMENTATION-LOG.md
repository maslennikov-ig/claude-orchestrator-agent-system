### Sync System (BONUS)

**What was implemented**:

1. **Sync Script**
   - File: `scripts/sync-local-agents.sh`

## 📝 Notes

**Development Pattern**:
1. Read spec → Create todo → Implement → Review → Commit → Sync
2. All changes in `templates/` first
3. Git hook auto-syncs to `.claude/` after commit
4. Test with synced agents locally

**Quality Standards**:
- All code reviewed by code-reviewer agent
- Comprehensive documentation for each component
- Examples covering all scenarios
- Error handling with graceful degradation

**Lessons Learned**:
- Parallel agent invocation speeds up implementation
- Comprehensive examples in specs reduce iteration time
- Auto-sync eliminates "sапожник без сапог" problem
- Git hooks provide zero-friction automation
