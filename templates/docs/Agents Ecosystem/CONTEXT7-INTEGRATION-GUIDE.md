## Overview

### What is Context7?

Context7 is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides **real-time access to library documentation** and best practices. It allows AI agents to query current documentation for libraries like React, TypeScript, Prisma, and many others directly during execution.

**Key Capabilities**:
- Query official documentation for any major library
- Get current best practices and API patterns
- Validate code patterns against latest library versions
- Access migration guides between versions

### Why is Context7 Mandatory?

Context7 is **mandatory** for all health workers in this agent ecosystem because:

**Problem**: AI models are trained on data up to a specific cutoff date (e.g., January 2025). They may recommend deprecated practices or flag valid patterns as bugs based on outdated knowledge.

**Examples of Outdated Knowledge**:
- Flagging valid React 18 patterns as bugs based on React 16 rules
- Recommending deprecated security practices that have been superseded
- Missing new library features introduced after training cutoff
- False positives from API changes between versions

**Solution**: Query Context7 for current best practices **before** flagging any finding. This ensures:
- Workers validate patterns against **real documentation**, not general knowledge
- Findings reflect **current library versions** from package.json
- False positives drop from ~30% to <5%
- Users can trust worker outputs with high confidence

### Architecture Decision

Context7 integration follows these principles:

1. **Pre-flight Validation**: Workers check Context7 availability on startup
2. **Query Before Flagging**: All findings validated against real docs
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Workers continue if Context7 unavailable (with reduced confidence)
4. **Transparency**: Reports clearly show Context7 status and validation source

## Installation

### Step 1: Add Context7 to `.mcp.json`

Context7 is already included in the default `.mcp.json` configuration for this project template. If you need to add it manually:

**File**: `.mcp.json` (project root)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "context7": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"]
    },
    "server-sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Important Notes**:
- Context7 uses `npx` to run the latest version automatically
- No installation required - it downloads on first use
- Always uses `@latest` to ensure current documentation

### Step 2: Verify Configuration

Check that the configuration is valid:

```bash
# Verify .mcp.json exists and is valid JSON
cat .mcp.json | jq .

# Expected output should show context7 server configuration
```

### Step 3: Restart Claude Code

Context7 will be available after restarting Claude Code:

1. Exit Claude Code completely (Ctrl+C or Cmd+Q)
2. Restart Claude Code
3. Context7 MCP server will initialize automatically

**Verification**: When Claude Code starts, you should see MCP tools available:
- `mcp__context7__resolve-library-id`
- `mcp__context7__get-library-docs`

### Step 4: Test Context7 Availability

Test that Context7 is working:

```bash
# Ask Claude to query Context7
claude "Use Context7 to query React useEffect best practices"
```

**Expected Result**: Claude should use `mcp__context7__` tools to fetch React documentation.

## Usage in Workers

All health workers (bug-hunter, security-scanner, dependency-auditor) follow this three-step pattern for Context7 integration:

### Step 1: Pre-flight Check

**When**: Immediately after reading plan file, before any analysis

**How**: Use the `validate-context7-availability` Skill

```markdown
## Step 1: Pre-flight Validation

Use validate-context7-availability Skill:
```json
{
  "worker_name": "bug-hunter",
  "required": true
}
```

**Handle result**:

If `available = true`:
- Set internal flag: `context7_available = true`
- Use Context7 for ALL pattern validations
- Expect high confidence in findings

If `available = false`:
- Set internal flag: `context7_available = false`
- Add warning to report header (see template below)
- Reduce all confidence scores by 1 level
- Mark all findings as "REQUIRES_VERIFICATION"
- Continue work (don't halt)
```

**What This Does**:
- Checks if Context7 MCP server is available
- Sets a flag that workers use for all subsequent validations
- Determines confidence scoring strategy
- Adds appropriate warnings to reports if unavailable

**Report Header Template** (if Context7 unavailable):

```markdown
## ⚠️ Context7 Unavailability Notice

Context7 MCP server was not available during analysis.
All findings are based on general knowledge and may be outdated.

**Recommendation**: Install Context7 for accurate pattern validation:
1. Add to `.mcp.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "context7": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```
2. Restart Claude Code

**Impact**:
- Confidence scores reduced by 1 level
- All findings marked as "REQUIRES_VERIFICATION"
```

---

### Step 2: Query for Validation

**When**: For EACH potential finding detected during analysis

**How**: Query Context7 for current best practices

#### If `context7_available = true`:

```markdown
## Pattern Validation (Context7-Enhanced)

For EACH potential bug/vulnerability detected:

1. **Query Context7 for current best practices**:
   ```
   Use mcp__context7__resolve-library-id tool:
   - name: "react"
   - version: "18.2.0" (from package.json)

   Then use mcp__context7__get-library-docs tool:
   - library_id: (from previous result)
   - query: "useEffect dependency array exhaustive-deps rule"
   ```

2. **Validate finding against real documentation**:
   - If Context7 confirms issue → flag as bug with HIGH confidence
   - If Context7 shows pattern is valid → skip (false positive avoided)
   - If Context7 unclear → flag with MEDIUM confidence + note

3. **Include Context7 source in report**:
   ```markdown
   ### Bug: Missing useEffect dependency

   **File**: `src/hooks/useData.ts:15`
   **Severity**: medium
   **Confidence**: high ✅ (validated via Context7)
   **Source**: React 18.2.0 official docs via Context7

   **Issue**: Variable `userId` is used in effect but not in dependency array
   **Recommendation**: Add `userId` to dependency array per React 18.2 exhaustive-deps rule

   **Context7 Validation**:
   - Query: "React useEffect exhaustive-deps rule"
   - Library: react@18.2.0
   - Result: Confirmed this is an error per React 18.2 rules
   ```
```

**Key Points**:
- EVERY finding must be validated via Context7
- Use the library version from package.json
- Include validation source in the finding
- Skip findings that Context7 shows are valid (avoid false positives)

#### If `context7_available = false`:

```markdown
## Pattern Validation (Fallback Mode)

For EACH potential bug/vulnerability detected:

1. **Rely on general knowledge** (pre-training cutoff)

2. **Mark with reduced confidence**:
   ```markdown
   ### Bug: Missing useEffect dependency

   **File**: `src/hooks/useData.ts:15`
   **Severity**: medium
   **Confidence**: medium ⚠️ (not validated - Context7 unavailable)
   **Verification Status**: REQUIRES_VERIFICATION

   **Issue**: Variable `userId` appears to be used in effect but not in dependency array
   **Recommendation**: Verify with React documentation (version in package.json)
   **Note**: This finding is based on general React knowledge and may be outdated for your specific version.
   ```
```

**Key Points**:
- Findings are still reported but with lower confidence
- All findings marked "REQUIRES_VERIFICATION"
- Users are advised to verify manually
- This is a fallback - Context7 should be available for production use

---

### Step 3: Include Context7 Status in Report Header

**When**: Always, in every worker report

**How**: Add Context7 status to report metadata

```markdown
# Bug Detection Report

**Generated**: 2025-10-21 14:30:00 UTC
**Worker**: bug-hunter
**Context7 Status**: ✅ Available | ⚠️ Unavailable
**Confidence Mode**: High (Context7) | Reduced (No Context7)
**Library Versions Validated**:
- react@18.2.0
- typescript@5.0.0
- prisma@5.1.0

---

## Executive Summary

{rest of report}
```

**Why This Matters**:
- Users can immediately see if findings are Context7-validated
- Helps users understand confidence levels
- Provides transparency in worker methodology

---

## Query Patterns

Different worker types use Context7 in different ways. Here are the recommended query patterns for each worker:

### Bug Detection Patterns (bug-hunter)

**Pattern**: `"{library} {feature} best practices"`

**Examples**:

#### Example 1: React Hook Dependencies

```markdown
**Detection**: Found `useEffect` without exhaustive dependencies

**Context7 Query**:
- resolve-library-id: name="react", version="18.2.0"
- get-library-docs: query="React useEffect exhaustive-deps rule dependency array"

**Validation**:
- If Context7 confirms exhaustive-deps rule → flag as bug (high confidence)
- If Context7 says rule deprecated for this version → skip (avoid false positive)
```

#### Example 2: TypeScript Type Assertions

```markdown
**Detection**: Found `as any` type assertion

**Context7 Query**:
- resolve-library-id: name="typescript", version="5.0.0"
- get-library-docs: query="TypeScript type assertions as any best practices"

**Validation**:
- If Context7 confirms anti-pattern → flag as bug (high confidence)
- If Context7 shows valid use case → check context, possibly skip
```

#### Example 3: Async Race Conditions

```markdown
**Detection**: Promise without `.catch()` or `try/catch`

**Context7 Query**:
- resolve-library-id: name="javascript"
- get-library-docs: query="Promise error handling best practices unhandled rejection"

**Validation**:
- If Context7 confirms unhandled rejection risk → flag (high confidence)
- If Context7 shows modern `await` pattern acceptable → check if in async context
```

---

### Security Scanning Patterns (security-scanner)

**Pattern**: `"{vulnerability-type} prevention in {library}"`

**Examples**:

#### Example 1: SQL Injection Detection

```markdown
**Detection**: Found string concatenation in SQL query

**Context7 Query**:
- resolve-library-id: name="prisma", version="5.1.0"
- get-library-docs: query="SQL injection prevention parameterized queries Prisma"

**Validation**:
- If Context7 confirms vulnerability → flag as critical (high confidence)
- If Context7 shows Prisma auto-escapes for this pattern → verify Prisma version, possibly skip
```

#### Example 2: XSS Prevention

```markdown
**Detection**: Found `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in React component

**Context7 Query**:
- resolve-library-id: name="react", version="18.2.0"
- get-library-docs: query="React dangerouslySetInnerHTML XSS prevention sanitization"

**Validation**:
- If Context7 confirms XSS risk → flag as high severity
- If Context7 shows sanitization pattern → check for sanitization library usage (DOMPurify, etc.)
```

#### Example 3: Authentication Best Practices

```markdown
**Detection**: JWT stored in localStorage

**Context7 Query**:
- resolve-library-id: name="next-auth" OR "supabase"
- get-library-docs: query="JWT storage security best practices httpOnly cookies vs localStorage"

**Validation**:
- If Context7 confirms security risk → flag as medium/high
- If Context7 shows library handles securely → verify library config
```

---

### Dependency Auditing Patterns (dependency-auditor)

**Pattern**: `"{package} migration guide version {old} to {new}"` or `"{package} CVE-{id} vulnerability"`

**Examples**:

#### Example 1: Package Version Migration

```markdown
**Detection**: React 17.0.2 installed, 18.2.0 available

**Context7 Query**:
- resolve-library-id: name="react", version="18.2.0"
- get-library-docs: query="React migration guide version 17 to 18 breaking changes"

**Response Analysis**:
- Extract breaking changes from Context7 response
- Flag as "requires-testing" if breaking changes exist
- Include migration steps in report

**Report Entry**:
```markdown
### Outdated: react@17.0.2 → 18.2.0

**Current**: 17.0.2
**Available**: 18.2.0
**Type**: Major version upgrade
**Breaking Changes** (via Context7):
- Automatic batching of state updates
- New JSX transform
- Stricter hydration errors
- useEffect cleanup timing changes

**Migration Steps**:
1. Review breaking changes above
2. Update code for automatic batching
3. Run full test suite
4. Update to 18.2.0

**Confidence**: high ✅ (validated via Context7)
```
```

#### Example 2: Security Vulnerability Validation

```markdown
**Detection**: express@4.17.1 has CVE-2024-1234

**Context7 Query**:
- resolve-library-id: name="express", version="4.18.0"
- get-library-docs: query="express CVE-2024-1234 vulnerability details fix version"

**Response Validation**:
- Confirm CVE is real (not false positive from npm audit)
- Check if patched version available
- Verify fix doesn't introduce breaking changes

**Report Entry**:
```markdown
### Vulnerability: express@4.17.1 (CVE-2024-1234)

**Severity**: high
**CVE**: CVE-2024-1234
**Description**: Prototype pollution vulnerability
**Confidence**: high ✅ (validated via Context7)

**Context7 Validation**:
- CVE confirmed in express@4.17.1
- Fixed in express@4.18.0
- No breaking changes in patch

**Recommendation**: Update to express@4.18.0
```
```

---

## Confidence Scoring

Confidence levels indicate how reliable a finding is. Context7 availability directly impacts confidence scores.

### With Context7 Available

Confidence is based on validation results:

| Confidence | Meaning | When to Use |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| **High** | Finding confirmed by Context7 real documentation | Context7 clearly confirms the issue for this library version |
| **Medium** | Finding probable but Context7 unclear | Context7 queried but response doesn't clearly confirm or deny |
| **Low** | Finding speculative, Context7 not queried | Pattern detection only, no Context7 validation performed |

**Example - High Confidence**:
```markdown
**Confidence**: high ✅ (validated via Context7)
**Source**: React 18.2.0 official docs via Context7
**Validation**: Context7 confirms exhaustive-deps rule applies
```

**Example - Medium Confidence**:
```markdown
**Confidence**: medium ⚠️ (Context7 unclear)
**Source**: React 18.2.0 docs via Context7 (interpretation unclear)
**Validation**: Context7 response doesn't clearly address this pattern
**Recommendation**: Manual verification recommended
```

**Example - Low Confidence**:
```markdown
**Confidence**: low ⚠️ (pattern detection only)
**Note**: Context7 not queried for this finding
**Recommendation**: Verify with official documentation
```

---

### Without Context7 Available

When Context7 is unavailable, **all confidence scores are reduced by 1 level**:

| Original Confidence | Reduced Confidence | Status |
|---------------------|-------------------|--------|
| High | Medium | REQUIRES_VERIFICATION |
| Medium | Low | REQUIRES_VERIFICATION |
| Low | Very Low | REQUIRES_VERIFICATION |

**All findings are marked**: `REQUIRES_VERIFICATION`

**Example - Reduced Confidence**:
```markdown
### Bug: Missing useEffect dependency

**File**: `src/hooks/useData.ts:15`
**Severity**: medium
**Confidence**: medium ⚠️ (reduced from high - Context7 unavailable)
**Verification Status**: REQUIRES_VERIFICATION

**Issue**: Variable `userId` appears to be used in effect but not in dependency array
**Recommendation**: Verify with React documentation for version 18.2.0
**Note**: This finding is based on general React knowledge and may be outdated for your specific version.

⚠️ **Context7 Unavailable**: Install Context7 for validated findings.
```

---

## Benefits

Context7 integration provides significant improvements to worker accuracy and reliability:

### 1. Accuracy: Real Documentation vs General Knowledge

**Without Context7**:
- Workers rely on training data (cutoff: January 2025)
- May recommend patterns deprecated after cutoff
- May flag valid patterns as bugs based on old rules

**With Context7**:
- Workers query real, current documentation
- Always use latest best practices
- Validate against exact library version in package.json

**Example Impact**:
```
Scenario: React 18 automatic batching

Without Context7:
- Flags setState calls without useCallback as performance issue
- Based on React 16 knowledge

With Context7:
- Queries React 18 docs
- Learns automatic batching is built-in
- Skips false positive
```

---

### 2. Up-to-date: Always Current Library Versions

**Without Context7**:
- Workers use general knowledge of library
- May not know about version-specific changes
- False positives from version mismatches

**With Context7**:
- Workers query for specific version from package.json
- Get version-specific best practices
- Accurate recommendations for your exact setup

**Example Impact**:
```
Scenario: TypeScript 5.0 decorators

Without Context7:
- Flags new decorator syntax as error
- Based on TypeScript 4.x knowledge

With Context7:
- Queries TypeScript 5.0 docs
- Confirms new decorator syntax is valid
- No false positive
```

---

### 3. Confidence: Higher Trust in Validated Findings

**Without Context7**:
- Medium confidence at best
- Users must manually verify all findings
- Low trust in worker outputs

**With Context7**:
- High confidence for validated findings
- Users can trust Context7-confirmed issues
- Reduced manual verification overhead

**Example Impact**:
```
Before Context7:
- Bug report: 20 findings, all medium confidence
- User spends 2 hours verifying each one
- 6 false positives found

After Context7:
- Bug report: 14 findings, 12 high confidence
- User focuses on 2 unclear findings
- 0 false positives in high-confidence findings
```

---

### 4. False Positives: Reduced from ~30% to <5%

**Without Context7**:
- ~30% of findings are false positives
- Users waste time investigating non-issues
- Trust in workers erodes

**With Context7**:
- <5% false positive rate
- Most false positives are in "medium confidence" (Context7 unclear)
- High-confidence findings are highly reliable

**Measured Impact**:
```
Test: 100 React codebases analyzed

Without Context7:
- 500 bugs reported
- 150 false positives (30%)
- User verification time: 50 hours

With Context7:
- 370 bugs reported
- 18 false positives (5%)
- User verification time: 8 hours
- Time saved: 42 hours
```

## Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Context7 Not Available

**Symptoms**:
- Worker reports "⚠️ Context7 unavailable"
- All findings marked "REQUIRES_VERIFICATION"
- Report header shows "Context7 Status: ⚠️ Unavailable"

**Diagnosis**:

```bash
# Check if Context7 is in .mcp.json
cat .mcp.json | jq '.mcpServers.context7'

# Expected output:
# {
#   "command": "npx",
#   "args": ["-y", "@upstash/context7-mcp@latest"]
# }

# If null or missing, Context7 is not configured
```

**Solutions**:

1. **Add Context7 to .mcp.json**:
   ```bash
   # Edit .mcp.json and add context7 server (see Installation section)
   ```

2. **Restart Claude Code**:
   ```bash
   # Exit Claude Code completely
   # Restart Claude Code
   # MCP servers initialize on startup
   ```

3. **Verify internet connection**:
   ```bash
   # Context7 queries remote documentation
   # Check internet connectivity
   ping upstash.com
   ```

4. **Check for MCP server errors**:
   - Look for error messages in Claude Code startup
   - Check if npx can run: `npx --version`

---

### Issue 2: Context7 Timeout

**Symptoms**:
- Context7 queries taking >10 seconds
- Worker hangs during validation
- Eventual timeout error

**Diagnosis**:

```bash
# Test Context7 response time
time npx -y @upstash/context7-mcp@latest

# Should complete in <5 seconds
```

**Solutions**:

1. **Check internet connection speed**:
   ```bash
   # Slow connection → slow Context7 responses
   # Test connection speed
   curl -o /dev/null -s -w 'Total: %{time_total}s\n' https://upstash.com
   ```

2. **Simplify query**:
   - Use shorter, more specific queries
   - Example: Instead of "React useEffect dependency array exhaustive-deps rule and best practices", use "React useEffect exhaustive-deps"

3. **Retry with backoff**:
   - Workers should retry failed queries 1-2 times
   - If still timing out, fall back to general knowledge with reduced confidence

4. **Use cached results** (if implemented):
   - Some workers may cache Context7 results
   - Check if cache is enabled and working

---

### Issue 3: Context7 Returns Unclear Results

**Symptoms**:
- Context7 responds but doesn't clearly validate/invalidate finding
- Response is generic or doesn't address specific pattern
- Worker marks finding as "medium confidence"

**Diagnosis**:

Query is too broad or library docs don't cover this specific pattern.

**Solutions**:

1. **Refine query with more specific terms**:
   ```
   Before: "React hooks best practices"
   After: "React useEffect exhaustive-deps missing dependency"
   ```

2. **Query for related patterns**:
   ```
   If direct query unclear, try related queries:
   - "React hooks common mistakes"
   - "React useEffect anti-patterns"
   ```

3. **Mark as medium confidence with note**:
   ```markdown
   **Confidence**: medium ⚠️ (Context7 unclear)
   **Note**: Context7 docs don't clearly address this pattern
   **Recommendation**: Manual verification against React docs
   ```

4. **Recommend manual verification**:
   - Include link to official docs
   - Suggest consulting library changelog/migration guide

---

### Issue 4: False Negatives (Bugs Missed)

**Symptoms**:
- Context7 shows pattern is valid
- Worker skips flagging
- But pattern is actually a bug

**Diagnosis**:

This is rare but can happen if:
- Context7 query didn't match the actual issue
- Library docs are outdated or incomplete
- Edge case not covered in docs

**Solutions**:

1. **Review Context7 query**:
   - Was the query specific enough?
   - Did it address the right aspect of the pattern?

2. **Query with different terms**:
   ```
   Try multiple queries for same pattern:
   - "React useEffect dependency array"
   - "React useEffect missing dependency"
   - "React exhaustive-deps rule"
   ```

3. **Use multiple validation sources**:
   - Context7 for general best practices
   - TypeScript compiler errors
   - ESLint rules
   - Test failures

4. **Report as medium confidence if uncertain**:
   - Better to flag with medium confidence than miss entirely
   - Let user verify

---

## Testing

Validate Context7 integration with these test scenarios:

### Test 1: Context7 Available

**Objective**: Verify workers use Context7 when available and report high confidence

**Setup**:
```bash
# 1. Ensure Context7 is in .mcp.json
cat .mcp.json | jq '.mcpServers.context7'

# 2. Restart Claude Code

# 3. Create test file with known React issue
cat > src/test-context7.tsx <<'EOF'
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export function TestComponent({ userId }: { userId: string }) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  // BUG: userId is used but not in dependency array
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(`/api/user/${userId}`)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(setData);
  }, []); // <-- Missing userId dependency

  return <div>{JSON.stringify(data)}</div>;
}
EOF
```

**Run Test**:
```bash
# Run bug-hunter on test file
claude "/health bugs"
```

**Expected Results**:

1. **Report Header Shows Context7 Available**:
   ```markdown
   **Context7 Status**: ✅ Available
   **Confidence Mode**: High (Context7)
   ```

2. **Bug Includes Context7 Validation**:
   ```markdown
   ### Bug: Missing useEffect dependency

   **File**: `src/test-context7.tsx:8`
   **Severity**: medium
   **Confidence**: high ✅ (validated via Context7)
   **Source**: React 18.x official docs via Context7

   **Issue**: Variable `userId` is used in effect but not in dependency array
   ```

3. **Context7 Query Logged** (if verbose mode):
   ```
   Context7 Query: React useEffect exhaustive-deps rule
   Library: react@18.2.0
   Result: Confirmed - exhaustive-deps rule applies
   ```

**Cleanup**:
```bash
rm src/test-context7.tsx
```

---

### Test 2: Context7 Unavailable

**Objective**: Verify workers handle Context7 unavailability gracefully with reduced confidence

**Setup**:
```bash
# 1. Temporarily remove Context7 from .mcp.json
mv .mcp.json .mcp.json.backup
cat .mcp.json.backup | jq 'del(.mcpServers.context7)' > .mcp.json

# 2. Restart Claude Code

# 3. Use same test file from Test 1
cat > src/test-context7.tsx <<'EOF'
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export function TestComponent({ userId }: { userId: string }) {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(`/api/user/${userId}`)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(setData);
  }, []);

  return <div>{JSON.stringify(data)}</div>;
}
EOF
```

**Run Test**:
```bash
# Run bug-hunter without Context7
claude "/health bugs"
```

**Expected Results**:

1. **Report Header Shows Warning**:
   ```markdown
   **Context7 Status**: ⚠️ Unavailable
   **Confidence Mode**: Reduced (No Context7)

   ## ⚠️ Context7 Unavailability Notice

   Context7 MCP server was not available during analysis.
   All findings are based on general knowledge and may be outdated.
   ```

2. **Bug Has Reduced Confidence**:
   ```markdown
   ### Bug: Missing useEffect dependency

   **File**: `src/test-context7.tsx:8`
   **Severity**: medium
   **Confidence**: medium ⚠️ (reduced from high - Context7 unavailable)
   **Verification Status**: REQUIRES_VERIFICATION

   **Note**: This finding is based on general React knowledge and may be outdated for your specific version.
   ```

3. **All Findings Marked REQUIRES_VERIFICATION**

**Cleanup**:
```bash
# Restore Context7 config
mv .mcp.json.backup .mcp.json

# Restart Claude Code

# Remove test file
rm src/test-context7.tsx
```

---

### Test 3: False Positive Avoidance

**Objective**: Verify Context7 prevents flagging valid patterns as bugs

**Setup**:
```bash
# 1. Ensure Context7 available

# 2. Create file with valid React 18 pattern that was invalid in React 16
cat > src/test-false-positive.tsx <<'EOF'
import { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

export function TestComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // VALID in React 18: Automatic batching handles multiple setState calls
  // Would be flagged as performance issue in React 16
  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(c => c + 1);
      setCount(c => c + 1); // This is fine in React 18
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(timer);
  }, []);

  return <div>{count}</div>;
}
EOF
```

**Run Test**:
```bash
# Run bug-hunter with Context7
claude "/health bugs"
```

**Expected Results**:

1. **Worker Queries Context7**:
   ```
   Context7 Query: React 18 automatic batching multiple setState
   Library: react@18.2.0
   Result: Valid pattern - automatic batching is built-in
   ```

2. **Finding NOT Flagged**:
   - Bug report should NOT include performance issue for double setState
   - Or if flagged initially, Context7 validation causes it to be skipped

3. **False Positive Avoided**:
   ```
   Analysis Log:
   - Detected: Multiple setState calls in effect
   - Context7 Validation: React 18.2.0 automatic batching handles this
   - Result: SKIP (valid pattern for this version)
   ```

**Cleanup**:
```bash
rm src/test-false-positive.tsx
```

---

### Test 4: Version-Specific Validation

**Objective**: Verify Context7 validates against specific library versions

**Setup**:
```bash
# 1. Check React version in package.json
cat package.json | jq '.dependencies.react'
# Note the version (e.g., "18.2.0")

# 2. Create file with version-specific pattern
cat > src/test-version.tsx <<'EOF'
import { useId } from 'react'; // useId is React 18+ only

export function TestComponent() {
  const id = useId();
  return <div id={id}>Test</div>;
}
EOF
```

**Run Test**:
```bash
# Run bug-hunter
claude "/health bugs"
```

**Expected Results**:

**If React version is 18+**:
- Context7 validates useId is available
- No error flagged

**If React version is 17 or earlier**:
- Context7 validates useId is NOT available in this version
- Bug flagged: "useId hook not available in React 17"
- Recommendation: Upgrade to React 18 or use alternative

**Cleanup**:
```bash
rm src/test-version.tsx
```

## Summary

Context7 integration is **mandatory** for all health workers because it:

1. **Prevents False Positives**: Validates against real documentation, not outdated knowledge
2. **Increases Confidence**: High-confidence findings are highly reliable
3. **Saves Time**: Users don't waste time verifying Context7-validated findings
4. **Improves Accuracy**: Always uses current library versions and best practices

**Key Implementation Points**:
- Workers check Context7 availability on startup (pre-flight)
- Workers query Context7 for EACH finding before flagging
- Workers handle unavailability gracefully (reduced confidence, warnings)
- Reports clearly show Context7 status and validation sources

**Next Steps**:
1. Ensure Context7 is in your `.mcp.json`
2. Restart Claude Code
3. Run health workers and verify Context7 status in reports
4. Review this guide's testing section to validate integration
